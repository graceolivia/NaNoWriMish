# NaNoWriMish
It's not exactly nanowrimo but it's nanowrim-ish, you know?

I'm doing a writing challenge this month and am tracking it here. 
25,000 words of fiction
4 nonfiction essays. No length requirement but they should be good.

## Update
**Four essay challenge:** Officially abandoned. Couldn't do it.
